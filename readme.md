If you're here thinking this will show up in your spawn menu â€” it won't.  
This is a utility for **mappers** only. Please **read everything** before leaving a comment or opening an issue.

## What is this?

This Garry's Mod addon adds **Lua-based soundscapes** for use in Hammer maps.  
I made this because dealing with Valveâ€™s default `soundscapes_manifest.txt` and sound scripts is a massive pain â€” so here's a simpler, easier alternative for custom soundscapes via Lua.

Dosent have all the features of regular soundscapes but its much easier to make custom ambiance

## Do Not Mix With Regular Soundscapes

**Important:**  
Do **not** mix these Lua-based soundscapes with Valveâ€™s default soundscape system in the same map.  
**Weird and undesirable things will happen.** Stick to one system or the other per map.
