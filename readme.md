If you're here thinking this will show up in your addons list — it won't.  
This is a utility for **mappers** only. Please **read everything** before leaving a comment or opening an issue.

## 🎵 What is this?

This Garry's Mod addon adds **Lua-based soundscapes** for use in Hammer maps.  
I made this because dealing with Valve’s default `soundscapes_manifest.txt` and sound scripts is a massive pain — so here's a better, cleaner alternative for custom soundscapes via Lua.

Perfect for mappers who want more control and flexibility when designing immersive sound environments.

## 🚫 Do Not Mix With Regular Soundscapes

**Important:**  
Do **not** mix these Lua-based soundscapes with Valve’s default soundscape system in the same map.  
**Weird and undesirable things will happen.** Stick to one system or the other per map.

## 🛠️ Tutorial

> A proper tutorial is coming soon.

In the meantime:
- You reference these Lua soundscapes from your map using entity logic.
- You do **not** interact with this addon in-game directly.
- Check the example map (if provided) or look at the Lua files for implementation patterns.
